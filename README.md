## About Mockito

Mockito is a mocking framework for Java that allows you to create test doubles (mocks) of objects in order to isolate the code under test and verify interactions with these objects. It provides a simple and intuitive API for setting up mock behaviors and verifying method invocations.

Mockito helps you write clean and maintainable tests by enabling you to:

- Create mocks of classes and interfaces.
- Specify mock behaviors, such as return values or exceptions.
- Verify method invocations on mocks.
- Stub method calls.
- Perform argument matching.
- And more.
